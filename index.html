        <h4>
            <p>I am a musician who has played with a diverse range of bands and artists both locally and abroad. <br>A guitar player by trade, my skillset has led to learning different types of music as well as different instruments. <p>Having managed several recording studios, I am also fluent with modern recording and mixing techniques. <br>Acting as composer, arranger, recordist, mixing, and mastering engineer on a wide variety of projects has <br>given me a specialized perspective on how to approach producing professional audio requirements for <br>a wide range of clients</p>
            <p>Computers and technology have also held a special fascination for me. This interest has sparked <br>a drive to learn programming and coding. My goal is to find a way to combine this with my passion <br>for music to create functional websites that serve as platforms for artistic expression</p>
